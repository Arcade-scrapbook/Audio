### Audio and Brightness Control
I created this project just for fun! It simulates audio and brightness controls, displaying them using LED lights. Please note that the functionality is not fully implemented yetâ€”it's more of a visual representation.

Additionally, I used a bit of AI assistance for optimization purposes after completing the project.

I understand that I am uploading this project late due to my exams. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to set up the repository, demo URL, or other details. I hope this will not be an issue. For verification, feel free to DM me on Slack, and I can share my exam timetable as proof.
